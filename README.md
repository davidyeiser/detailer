# ⚠️ RETIRED

This is a plugin for WordPress (named **Detailer**) that creates a custom Gutenberg block called **Book Details**. It was a companion repository for a two-part tutorial on creating your own dynamic Gutenberg block for WordPress (no longer accessible). It was written when Gutenberg blocks were new and is now very out of date and I would not recommend using it as a reference!

## Credit

The structure and setup of this repository is taken from [@zgordon/how-to-gutenberg-plugin](https://github.com/zgordon/how-to-gutenberg-plugin). All credit for its cleverness goes to Zac Gordon. Blame for any errors goes to me.

## Setup

Place this project directory in `wp-content/plugins` and then, in the `wp-content/plugins/detailer` directory, run:

```
yarn
```

To build the files **for development** run:

```
yarn dev
```

To build the files **for production** run:

```
yarn build
```
